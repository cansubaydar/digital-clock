## Digital Clock 
The purpose of this project is to create a digital clock to practice JavaScript.

#### The steps I followed for this project
- Created a `new Date` object for the time. The time zone is local.
- Got the current hour, minute and second from the date object using the `getHours()`, `getMinutes()` and `getSeconds()` methods. Extracted respective values with these different methods and stored in different variables. 
- Used ternary operators and appended a `0` to the single-digits.
- Added the values to a `div` element using the `textContent` property via the DOM.
- Used `setInterval()` method to call the function every second.
